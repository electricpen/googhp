This project was my first attempt to build a webpage in practice after going through the basic tutorials on codeacademy and odin on basic html/css.

It was quite challenging both from a lack of knowledge retention from the quick introduction of many tags and command arguments and also from a few inconsistencies with example code I found online and how it actually functioned in my own page. Namely making flat geometric shapes with empty div commands as in the android mascot exercise never worked properly for me. In this exercise in order to have the grey bar element at the bottom of the homepage show I needed to put an empty <p> element into the div. In several examples I found online nobody else has to do this. One situation a teacher would be handy to ask why it didn't work.

I believe this exercise was useful though. Codeacademy walkthroughs are not that good for retaining information without the practice of actually trying to build a page with the tools.
